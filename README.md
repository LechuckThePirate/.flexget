#My [Flexget](https://github.com/Flexget/Flexget) Setup

Largely inspired to [jawilson](https://github.com/jawilson) setup. 

All private information (username, passwords, api keys and so on) are kept in a separate yaml file to be merged in at runtime by my [config_secret](https://github.com/tarzasai/.flexget/blob/master/plugins/config_secrets.py) plugin (details [here](https://github.com/Flexget/Flexget/pull/249)).
